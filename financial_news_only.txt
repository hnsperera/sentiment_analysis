0   Policy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers.
0   The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.

1   In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February.
"All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather," he said according to prepared remarks.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.
Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.

Fed's Plosser: Taper pace may be too slow#http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-plosser-taper-pace-may-be-too-slow-2014-03-10\?reflink=MW_news_stmp#1394470372405#“We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,” Plosser told a panel in Paris.
As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion.
At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.
But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.
“Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,” he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.
Fed's Plosser expects US unemployment to fall to 6.2% by the end of 2014#http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx\?storyid=23285020-b1b5-47ed-a8c4-96124bb91a39#1394470372615#FXStreet (Łódź) - Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said today in a speech delivered at the Bank of France alongside Governor Christian Noyer that he expected US unemployment to drop even lower than 6.2% by the end of the year.
The voting FOMC member suggested that the last three Nonfarm Payrolls monthly readings were weaker due to the “effect of the unusually severe winter weather,” but that he expected the US labor market to improve from now on.
He also suggested that the US economy would expand by around 3% this year and that upside risks to inflation existed in the longer term.
Plosser, a critic of the Fed's quantitative easing program, also expressed hope that the central bank's monetary policy would return to “normalcy” as soon as possible.

Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.

The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.

That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send.
For the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to “the high degree of unutilised capacity” in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term.
“Our monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy,” ECB President Mario Draghi said.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.
The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.
A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors deciding whether they need billions of euros of extra capital.
The tests are being done to restore investor confidence and clean up any lingering problems in the euro zone’s banks before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.
The methods some euro zone banks use to decide if a loan has turned sour will fall short of those in the ECB’s review of banks’ loan books, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The ECB declined to comment.

Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen.
Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.
Beyond loans, the ECB’s treatment of ‘Level 3 assets’, a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched.
Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles.

REUTERS/Charles PlatiauNoyer, who is governor of the Bank of France, warned that “permanent and deep forces” were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.
“Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,” Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.
Noyer cited vast slack in many economies as a source of low inflation as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.

Noyer cited slack in many economies as a source of low inflation, as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.
The Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB’s target of close to but less than 2.0 percent.
Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates.

"This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability."
Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area.
"Low inflation is not deflation," Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run.
The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

Reinvigorating the eurozone economy requires a more radical effort to resolve the inter-linked sovereign-debt and banking crises.
As it stands, Europe’s political class is committed to internal devaluation in all of the troubled eurozone economies.
The predicament of Europe’s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition.
The question is whether that would mean that some or all eurozone countries must go their separate ways.
ECB Unlocks Door for Further Euro Strength - Will Data Allow?#http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/eur/2014/03/08/ECB_Unlocks_Door_for_Further_Euro_Strength_Will_Data_Allow.html#1394470508177#The Euro’s resiliency continued to shine this week as a bout of mixed economic data took a backseat to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday.
The Euro’s strength came through in the last two days of the week, and its gains elsewhere are constructive going forward.
As ECB President Mario Draghi made clear in the press conference on Thursday, the ECB does not want to simply just inject more liquidity into the Euro-Zone banking system; there is little need right now.
Instead, so as to prevent unnecessary confusion about the health of the banking system, the ECB is stuck in neutral.
For now, data needs to remain sturdy as the door remains open for further Euro gains.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.
Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.
The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.
EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

Criticizing the same Skype transaction he has taken Andreessen to task over, Icahn says Donahoe's "inexcusable incompetence" cost EBay shareholders more than $4 billion.
Icahn's latest barrage reiterates his charge that shareholders got fleeced in a deal that helped line the pockets of a board member for stepping in as middleman.
The letter, which came after Ebay rejected Icahn's proposed board slate Monday, also calls out Donahoe for trailing industry peers.
Two things remain clear: Icahn won't get his way without a fight and Ebay's management and board are going to give him one.

eBay subsequently offered by letter to provide the Icahn Group with documents responsive to their Section 220 demands.
Throughout January, February and March, the Icahn Group and the Company published various solicitation materials.
eBay Rejects Carl Icahn's Board Nominees And Says His Attacks Are 'False And  ...#http://www.businessinsider.in/eBay-Rejects-Carl-Icahns-Board-Nominees-And-Says-His-Attacks-Are-False-And-Misleading/articleshow/31796115.cms#1394470923475#In his letters, Icahn has also been making two demands: That PayPal spin-off from eBay and that two of his employees join the company's board.
Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.
eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.
In his latest letter to the eBay's board this morning, Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.
eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a "false and misleading" attack:John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008.

Icahn, who owns just over 2% of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business.
The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.
The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.
EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

Icahn insists that eBay spin off its lucrative PayPal platform—an idea dismissed the company has dismissed.
"PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google, Apple, Visa, etc," the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.
"To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty.
Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal.
Carl Icahn slams eBay CEO#http://www.cityam.com/blog/1394460724/carl-icahn-slams-ebay-ceo#1394470924237#Guy BentleyIn another open letter to eBay stockholders, activist investor Carl Icahn has blasted the company's CEO for actions that he believes have cost the e-commerce giant $4bn (£2.4bn).
Icahn alleges that John Donahoe cost eBay $4bn when he sold Skype in 2009, in what he called a "premature sale" at a "diminished price."
The investment guru struck out at what he called Donahoe's "inexcusable incompetance."
He reiterated his call for the separation of eBay and payments company PayPal.
Icahn has promised to share with stockholders in-depth analysis of what he considers the "sordid affair" regarding the Skype sale.

At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,” the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.
Icahn insists that eBay spin off its fast-growing PayPal payments business – an idea dismissed by the company.

He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.
Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the “facts” about this were disclosed.
On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal’s new users.
The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal’s success and makes it “smarter.” In addition, it states that it funds the services provider’s growth.

Icahn's employees, Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, were "not qualified candidates" because they did not have "relevant experience or expertise" and already served on a number of boards for other public companies, the eBay board said in a statement, which misspelled the last name of Ninivaggi.
The eBay board also nominated four existing directors for re-election, including the company's president, John Donahoe.

After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's has been struggling to boost sales as people increasingly flock to places like Chipotle and Five Guys Burgers and Fries.
"A long time ago, mass appeal had to be mass appeal," Jeff Stratton, the president of McDonald's USA said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.
The restaurants are adapting to a world where McDonald's traditional strength — consistency — isn't always enough.
Globally, McDonald's said sales declined 0.3 percent at locations open at least 13 months in February.

The absence of real per capita disposable income growth that has hurt retailers like Wal-Mart /quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald’s, analysts said.
According to the National Restaurant Association’s 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year’s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators.
And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way.
To reverse waning demand, McDonald’s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers.

Bull market celebrates its 5th birthday: But is the party over?#http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/the-stock-market-rally-is-5-years-old-today--can-it-last-another-year--141435188.html#1394472085313#Five years ago today the stock market, reeling from the financial crisis, hit bottom.
Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?
And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability.
The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally.
Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.

Dow Jones Industrial Average: 5 Year Stock Market Crash Anniversary [Direxion  ...#http://etfdailynews.com/2014/03/10/dow-jones-industrial-average-5-year-stock-market-crash-anniversary/#1394472086557#Tara Clarke: The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.
However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.
The bull market that began in 1982 lasted about 60 months before the 1987 stock market crash.
The past two bull markets were immediately followed by crushing bear markets, and 2009’s fallout was the biggest since the Great Depression.
The third and final sign making investors wary of a stock market crash is U.S. Federal Reserve action.
Dow Averaging 3% Since 2000#http://news.stocktradersdaily.com/news_releases/Dow+Averaging+3+percent+Since+2000+31014.html#1394472086775#The Dow Jones industrial average (NYSE:DIA) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and NASDAQ (NYSE:QQQ) handily.
Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time.
The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily).
Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.
Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy.

Dow Jones Transportation Average Pushing Higher#http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dow-jones-transportation-average-pushing-higher-cm333680#1394472087799#With both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index hovering just below major trend line resistance levels, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) continues to push to new highs and well above former “channel top” resistance.
Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.
Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.
That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.
As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.

The S&P 500 held onto its gains thanks to strength in the financial sector, which posted a 3% gain for the week.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P 500 gained 1%, the Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.7%.
I focused on the small- and mid-cap stocks for this report, but the broad-based S&P 500 scored four consecutive new intraday highs last week.
Patience is the key to success, and chasing stocks that are making new highs is a high-risk proposition in a stock market that is celebrating its fifth year as a bull.

Click to EnlargeThis has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market — the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.
However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth.
But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.

I’m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors.
I certainly doubt whether we’re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.
I’d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country.
The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward.

Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.
With the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying?
Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.
When it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance.

It's about what you'd expect from a 5-year-old.
And so it has been recently with the stock market, which marks the fifth anniversary on March 9 of its bear-market lows, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index touched 666, the mark of the Devil from the Book of Revelation, following a near-biblical set of plagues loosed on the financial system and the world economy in 2007-08.

Plus, some of the funds with the best five-year returns led the pack because they focused on the riskiest investments.
To see how big the numbers are, check the performance of the largest mutual fund by assets.
Many bond mutual funds in 2013 had their first down year in more than a decade amid rising interest rates.

During DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.
Lawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (£344m).
It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.

UK's first bitcoin machine opens in east London cafe#http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-international/uks-first-bitcoin-machine-opens-in-east-london-caf#1394474340583#Britain’s first machine for dispensing digital currency opened for business in a cafe near London’s “Silicon roundabout” tech hub in east London on Friday, offering customers the ability to exchange bank notes for bitcoins.
He sees a mainstream future for the virtual currency, even though the top bitcoin exchange has collapsed and the currency has been volatile due to speculation as well as prone to criminal activities.
Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, declared bankruptcy saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
In 2012, a leaked FBI report said the virtual currency was an “increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm”.
Customers who use the machine in East London are charged an 8 percent commission, and each customer is limited to 1,000 pounds ($1,700) in transactions per month.

In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered – or more often, not covered – by existing law.
The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt.Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says.
Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, “we have not grasped the situation in its entirety."

It's in good company, joining Seattle and Austin, which were the first cities to host pop-up Bitcoin ATMs last month.
The cash machine can be found inside the Old Shoreditch Cafe and Bar, and lets people top-up their Bitcoin wallets easily by scanning the QR code from their Bitcoin wallet, where they can insert up to £1,000 in cash, and bam!
Sadly it doesn't work the other way around, as the cafe's owner, Joel Raziel, has decided against letting people use the machine to swap their Bitcoins for real cash.
The machine has apparently been a big success, with one nutter man coming all the way from Manchester for the chance to use the machine.

Officials from the Finance Ministry, Financial Services Agency and Bank of Japan have said they’re not in a position to oversee Bitcoin.
Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Alberta, Canada, was forced to shut down this week after hackers stole 896 units of the digital currency, the Guardian newspaper reported March 5.
Dorian S. Nakamoto, a physicist identified by Newsweek magazine as the creator, yesterday denied involvement in the digital currency before leading reporters on a multi-vehicle car chase and entering an Associated Press bureau.

Japan says Bitcoin not a currency, but taxable#http://en.tengrinews.kz/finance/Japan-says-Bitcoin-not-a-currency-but-taxable-26574/#1394474342916#0Bitcoin is not a currency but transactions involving it should be "subject to taxation", Japan's government said Friday, in a move that could pave the way for formal regulations on the troubled virtual unit, AFP reports.Tokyo also said that banks could not broker Bitcoin transactions or open accounts holding the virtual unit, which launched just five years ago, in an apparent bid to clamp down on the digital currency.But, as regulators around the world grapple with how to handle Bitcoin, the Japanese statement did not specify if Tokyo would immediately begin cracking down on it, or how it would do so, given the unit's opaque nature.Bitcoin "does not fall under the category of a currency" as defined by Japanese law, the government statement said, echoing the views of central banks in other countries.And "generally speaking it is subject to taxation if it meets conditions laid out in income tax law, corporate tax law and sales tax law, among others", the statement added.If Bitcoin transactions were used for money laundering "that would constitute a crime", it said, adding that "there are no Japanese laws that clearly define Bitcoin".
"As a matter of common sense, if there are transactions and subsequent gains, it is natural... for the finance ministry to consider how it can impose taxes," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday.Asked whether Japan would become a global leader on regulating Bitcoin, Suga said: "We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do.
"Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.Last week, the spectacular failure of the Japan-based MtGox trading exchange set off alarm bells over Bitcoin, which backers have promoted as a low-cost alternative to fiat currencies such as the US dollar or Japanese yen.US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it.
Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.Yellen has said US regulators, including the Treasury, are watching the Bitcoin sector for potential money laundering and other criminal uses of the digital currency.MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 percent of global Bitcoin transactions, last week sought bankruptcy protection and admitted that it lost half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency.Suga said Friday that Japanese officials were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.This week, an alleged theft of $600,000 worth of the currency by hackers forced a Canada-based online business serving Bitcoin traders and investors to shut down.In more misfortune linked with the troubled currency, Singapore police on Thursday said they were investigating the "unnatural"death of a 28-year-old American boss of a Bitcoin exchange.Autumn Radtke, chief executive of Singapore-based First Meta, was found dead on February 26, but no foul play was suspected, police said.Also on Thursday, Newsweek claimed it had found the true identity of the mysterious person or group behind the Bitcoin revolution -- "Satoshi Nakamoto", a 64-year-old, Japanese-American physicist and model train enthusiast.Nakamoto has denied being involved in Bitcoin.The Bitcoin Foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm Newsweek's story.After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $650 level.

By April of last year, the number of daily Bitcoin transactions had reached 70,000, remarkable for a currency that debuted in 2009.
But the estimated total value of Bitcoin transactions was a mere $2 billion — not even a rounding error in a global economy of $72 trillion.
Why not an electronic currency, recognized worldwide, to fill out what’s already an overwhelmingly electronic financial world?

But now Bitcoin has launched its first cash machine in the UK located at the Old Shoreditch Cafe and bar in east London.
The bitcoin dispensers will also scan government-issued identification such as a driver's licence or a passport to confirm users' identities.
Customers use a mobile wallet app on their phone to display a QR code pointing to their Bitcoin wallet, which the cash machine scans and sends money to.
The cash machine charges a eight per cent commission but this is hoped to be reduced once the machine, which is currently manually topped up is converted to automated.

Democrat donor William Ackman conspires to destroy Herbalife to win billion  ...#http://washingtonexaminer.com/democrat-donor-william-ackman-conspires-to-destroy-herbalife-to-win-billion-dollar-bet/article/2545402#1394479007477#If the billionaire Koch brothers are trying to “buy our democracy,” as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., put it, what is Democrat donor William Ackman buying?
The billionaire hedge fund manager has conspired with members of Congress and outside groups to destroy Herbalife, a nutrition products company, according to the New York Times.
To win a billion-dollar bet he made that the company would collapse.
Ackman read from a letter he said was written by Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife.
Ackman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife — including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn.

REVEALED: How Bill Ackman Has Been Lobbying To Bring Down A Company  ...#http://www.businessinsider.in/REVEALED-How-Bill-Ackman-Has-Been-Lobbying-To-Bring-Down-A-Company-That-Hes-Bet-1-Billion-Will-Collapse/articleshow/31796517.cms#1394479008603#The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.
In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.
Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a "pyramid scheme" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population.
Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses.
Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short "to the end of the earth."
Ackman and Herbalife#http://www.futureofcapitalism.com/2014/03/ackman-and-herbalife#1394479008789#The New York Times has a long article detailing the lobbying on both sides, but particularly Bill Ackman's short-selling side, of the battle over Herbalife.
Earlier coverage of Herbalife and of Mr. Ackman from this site is here, here, and here.
Not among the three bylines on the Times article is Alison Leigh Cowan, who was described in the book Confidence Game as Mr. Ackman's pipeline into the Times.
In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to start up the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.
The press can be almost as powerful as, or even more powerful than, the regulators in these high-stakes battles involving shortsellers and battleground stocks.

An investigation by the Times found Ackman’s team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife.
The report says Ackman’s team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife.
Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman’s charges.

The research firm identifies positive and negative press coverage by monitoring more than 20 million blog and news sources in real-time.
Accern ranks coverage of companies on a scale of negative one to positive one, with scores nearest to one being the most favorable.
JetBlue Airways earned a news impact score of 0.10 on Accern's scale.
They also gave news coverage about the transportation company an impact score of 45.90 out of 100, meaning that recent press coverage is somewhat unlikely to have an effect on the company's share price in the immediate future.

Public Transit Ridership Up Nationally#http://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/public-transit-ridership-nationally#1394480225457#The American Public Transportation Association released a report today stating Americans took a record high number of trips on U.S. public transportation last year.
People across the country took 10.7 billion rides on public transit in 2013.
Miller was in Washington D.C. Monday, asking Congress to invest more in public transportation.
"The younger generations are riding transit more and driving less and in Pinellas County we're definitely looking to the future at that," he said.

Is spitting in TriMet driver's face 'assault'? Union wants hostile riders taken more  ...#http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2014/03/is_spitting_in_trimet_drivers.html#1394480226533#In the past 18 months, TriMet bus drivers have been on the receiving end of some brutal attacks, including three stabbings and a vicious beating at a North Portland stop last fall.
On that, the driver’s union and management at Oregon’s largest transit agency agree.
TriMet officials have maintained that serious assaults on its drivers -- while a heinous reality of the job -- are rare.
(Not surprisingly, most reported confrontations result from bus drivers simply asking free-loaders to pay their fare.)
One of the reported assaults was an unwanted kiss.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession.
With services restored after economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

American Use Of Public Transit Has Hit Its Highest Point In 50 Years#http://www.businessinsider.com/american-public-transit-use-highest-since-1957-2014-3#1394480227146#Thomas Hawk/Flickr Americans took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year, the most since 1957, according to a new report from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
From 2012 to 2013, public transit use rose 1.1%, while miles driven rose .3%.
Since 1995, public transit use has grown by 37.2%, while the population rose 20.3%.
The APTA report attributes the growth to the economic recovery, which creates more commutes, and federal investment in public transit.
"That is why Congress needs to act this year to pass a new transportation bill," APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy said in a press release.

Record Number Of Public Transportation Trips Taken In 2013#http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/record-number-public-transportation-trips-2013-64158/#1394480228380#The number of rides taken on public transportation systems in the United States last year was the highest it has been since the 1950s, according to a report from the American Public Transportation Association released today.
While Indiana has less public transportation than some other states, it is in line with the upward trend.
IndyGo reported more than 10.2 million dixed route trips taken on its buses, its highest number since 1991.
President and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association Michael Melaniphy says the report’s findings reveal a fundamental change in people’s lifestyles.
About 50 percent of all trips are on transit.”According to the Indiana Department of Transportation’s 2012 Public Transit Report, one percent of people over 16 used public transportation to get to work in Indiana, compared to the national average of 5.2 percent.
Public Transportation Use Highest Since 1950s#http://missionlocal.org/2014/03/public-transportation-use-highest-since-1950s/#1394480228556#The NYT today reports on a study out by the American Public Transportation Association on the jump in 2013 in public transit use.
The trade group said in its annual report that 10.65 billion passenger trips were taken on transit systems during the year, surpassing the post-1950s peak of 10.59 billion in 2008, when gas prices rose to $4 to $5 a gallon.
The ridership in 2013, when gas prices were lower than in 2008, undermines the conventional wisdom that transit use rises when those prices exceed a certain threshold, and suggests that other forces are bolstering enthusiasm for public transportation, said Michael Melaniphy, the president of the association.

This isn’t just a blip.”Among other large systems, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) light rail transit ridership rose 6% from 2012 levels, in part due to LACMTA’s expanding LRT reach.
Including bus transport, LACMTA ridership rose 1.9% over 2012 levels.

The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership.
Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year.
Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent.
Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent.

According to the American Public Transportation Association, ridership hasn’t been that high since 1956.

Ridership on Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority (DART) buses was up 15 percent year-over-year in December.
December ridership totaled 347,213 passengers.
The increase is significant because December is the first month for which year-over-year comparisons can be made after DART added or changed a number of routes in November 2012.

The American Public Transportation Association’s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years.
Young people traveling more often at “off-peak” times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported.
Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.
It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.

That's according to new figures released by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
In fact, more than 10.7 billion journeys were made by public transit nationally, and transit ridership is up 37.2 percent since 1995.
Certainly, as the APTA notes, the economic recovery will be playing a role.
But there are broader trends that point to a long-term growth in ridership, including increased urbanization.

The APTA claims the opposite:Another reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas.
Light rail (modern streetcars, trolleys, and heritage trolleys) ridership increased 1.6 percent in 2013 with 17 out of 27 transit systems reporting increases.

Public Transit Use At Highest Level Since 1956#http://time.com/18135/public-transit-use-at-highest-level-since-1956/#1394480234457#Public transportation trips reached 10.7 billion last year, the greatest number of rides since 1956.
Overall public transportation use grew 1.1% in 2013, and is up 37.2% from 1995 when transportation use outpaced population growth in the U.S., according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
Last year was the eighth year in a row that over 10 billion trips were taken on public transportation across America.
The APTA says economic recovery is a predominant reason for more transit rides, since public transportation use increases when more people have jobs.
The APTA reports that about 60% of trips taken last year were people commuting to work.
Public Transit Use In U.S. Is At a 57-Year High, Report Finds#http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/03/10/3382001/public-transit-ridership-increase/#1394480234658#More Americans used public transit last year than in any year since 1956, according to a new report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
The report found that public transit ridership in the U.S. has jumped 37.2 percent since 1995, an increase that’s outpaced population growth and vehicle miles traveled.
AdvertisementThe last time public transit ridership was at an all-time high was 2008, when gas prices spiked in the U.S., reaching $4 and $5 per gallon in some places.
And, Melaniphy said, the inverse is true as well: cities that invest in public transit often see shrinking unemployment rates, because people have access to job opportunities that may have been off-limits before.
Americans aren’t just taking public transit more often, however.
Americans make most journeys on public transport for 50 years#http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/american-make-most-journeys-on-public-transport-for-50-years#1394480235012#They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.
Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis.
With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association.
Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain.

Could the Flight MH370 Rescue Bring China and Japan Closer Together?#http://thediplomat.com/2014/03/could-the-flight-mh370-rescue-bring-china-and-japan-closer-together/#1394481299427#According to China Daily (Chinese), as of March 9, 11 countries have joined in an international search and rescue operation after this flight mysteriously disappeared from radar.
China Daily says vessels and aircraft in this international rescue operation come from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain.
There are no Japanese citizens on MH370, and given the current situation on East China Sea, Japan certainly has no obligation to join the rescue.
So what if Japan had volunteered to join the MH370 international rescue operation?
Both China and Japan should find or create these opportunities.

Brent Slides Towards $108 On Chinese Exports#http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/03/4376347/brent-slides-towards-108-on-chinese-exports#1394481302449#Brent crude oil fell below $109 to start the week on poor data from China, but supply worries helped underpin prices.
Bloomberg reported that China released data on Monday showing that the nation's exports unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier.
The data compounded the already growing worry that the Chinese economy is slowing down as it followed poor PMI data released last week.
However, the ongoing tension in Ukraine kept a floor under Brent prices as Russian forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula over the weekend.
Tension in Libya also supported Brent prices as armed protesters clashed with the nation's government on Sunday over the sale of oil from a rebel held port.

UPDATE 2-EU deals blow to two big Russian gas pipeline projects#http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/ukraine-oettinger-pipeline-idUSL6N0M71V020140310#1394485179219#Russia has begun building the South Stream pipeline project to carry up to 15 percent of Europe’s annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018.
“I won’t accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being; they will be delayed,” Oettinger, a German national, was quoted as saying.
Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said he was referring only to political talks but said he had made clear that South Stream faces a long wait for legal clearance.
BLOW TO EXISTING PIPELINEOne of Russia’s existing alternative routes to supply western Europe without passing Ukraine, the Nord Stream Pipeline, was also hit on Monday.
Introduced in 2011, Nord Stream pumps gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea into Germany.
EU delays talks on Russian pipeline#http://www.columbiatribune.com/business/eu-delays-talks-on-russian-pipeline/article_58368ab6-a875-11e3-b88b-10604b9f6eda.html#1394485179419#BRUSSELS (AP) � The European Commission is delaying some talks on a new Russian pipeline that would bypass Ukraine to move natural gas via the Black Sea to southeastern Europe.
Spokeswoman Sabine Berger said today the commission, the 28-country bloc's executive arm, will continue talks at a technical level but suspend planned political negotiations in light "of the broader developments" in the European Union's relations with Russia.
The European Union last week suspended talks on visa liberalization and an economic pact with Moscow to protest against Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

Four nations urge U.S. gas exports#http://www.columbiatribune.com/business/four-nations-urge-u-s-gas-exports/article_5820dd1a-a875-11e3-b87d-10604b9f6eda.html#1394485179620#WASHINGTON (AP) � Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the possibility that Russia could cut off its supply of gas to Ukraine.
The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports, noting that the "presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe."
Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes between Ukraine and Russia have led to gas supply cuts.
But with gas supplies limited, the region is still vulnerable unless the United States makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.
Boehner and Republicans have been urging the Obama administration to clear the way for more exports amid a natural gas boom in the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT"As events in Ukraine bring back the memories of the Cold War, from which all of our countries suffered terribly, we are writing to highlight the overall importance of U.S. engagement in Central and Eastern Europe, and more specifically in the area of energy security and reliable supply of natural gas," the letter states.Still, experts say the infrastructure is not ready in the U.S. to speed up natural gas exports.
"As a result, in 2013 alone, Ukraine imported almost 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Poland and Hungary.

Ukraine Crisis: LNG Stocks in Focus - Analyst Blog#http://www.nasdaq.com/article/ukraine-crisis-lng-stocks-in-focus-analyst-blog-cm333894#1394485180233#Russia's bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for Europe.
1   The most viable alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale revolution, is flush with the commodity.With the success of 'shale gas' - the kind trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations - and the advent of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two thirds.
This gives the U.S. leeway to export some of the excess and cheap gas through sea - in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) - to the European markets.Let's look at some companies that are likely to benefit a great deal from the growth and development of the LNG markets.Houston, Texas-based LNG ) is the first name that comes to mind.
The only Federal Energy Regulatory Commission/FERC -approved operator in this space with the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has got the first mover advantage.
Importantly, this will loosen Russia's energy squeeze on Europe and provide the region with long-term energy security.
Canada's LNG export industry could benefit from the “Ukrainian Crisis”#http://www.troymedia.com/2014/03/10/canadas-lng-export-industry-could-benefit-from-the-ukrainian-crisis/#1394485180435#236 0EDMONTON, AB, Mar 10, 2014/ Troy Media/ – The “Ukrainian Crisis” could be a game changer for the Canadian and global energy industry.
But in terms of the global gas industry, these are minor plays and do not impact anyone outside of Ukraine.
This will change the entire world gas industry.
The “Ukraine Crisis”, as bloody as it is, provides opportunities for the Canadian industry, which, until now, has lagged behind the U.S. in development due to a lack of export infrastructure.
This is a conversation that is good for Canada’s LNG export industry and shows the importance of a secure and safe supply of LNG.
Ukraine caught in Russia's tussle for power with the West#http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1445252/ukraine-caught-russias-tussle-power-west#1394485180762#Ukraine is a lynchpin for Russia's energy supplies to Europe, while Russia's Black Sea Fleet based in Crimea's Sevastopol is the core of Russia's Eurasian power projection.
So the loss of Ukraine to the fold of the West would not only threaten Russia's national security but also unravel Putin's Eurasian dream.
For the West, Ukraine's about-turn presents a hard-won opening for bringing the country, whose western part is fiercely anti-Russia, into the EU fold - a further step to diminish Russia's stranglehold over Eastern Europe.
From a cost-benefit perspective, Russian energy supply would seem to be a more effective leverage over Ukraine.
The US is warning against Russian military intervention, threatening visa bans and asset freezes.

A long, winding road to marketGetting U.S. natural gas on the international market has been a major struggle for producers for years.
The safest by far, in my opinion, is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), which has been putting a lot of money into expanding its natural gas business in recent years.
It stands as a responsibly priced company that is growing natural gas production at just the right time.
Rather, Gazprom is the market leader, by far the largest natural gas company in the world.
White House: Exporting natural gas to Europe, Ukraine not the answer#http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/10/wh-exporting-natural-gas-europe-ukraine-not-answer/#1394485181226#The Obama administration on Monday downplayed the notion that American natural gas exports could immediately lessen Russian leverage over Ukraine and Europe, but the idea is very much alive and gaining momentum on Capitol Hill.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to fast-track legislation expediting the federal approval process for liquefied natural gas export terminals, two dozen of which remain trapped in lengthy reviews inside the Energy Department.
1   Republicans long have prodded the White House to speed up the process and take advantage of America’s abundance of natural gas by selling to allies in Europe and elsewhere.
But the White House brushed off the notion that U.S. gas exports could have any impact on the current crisis in Ukraine.

Russia Could Fend off US LNG Plans for Europe#http://www.marinelink.com/news/russia-europe-plans365266.aspx#1394485181444#Asia is Better for LNGEuropean spot gas prices currently stand at around $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), half of what Asian buyers pay.
Although U.S. spot gas prices are low, however, forward curves show prices rising in North America while Europe's contracts come down.
That means even just slight further rebates by Russia or a move towards more EU spot market indexation would effectively push U.S. LNG out of the market in Europe.
That points to LNG cargoes steering away from Europe towards higher-value Asian and Latin American markets given current price trends.
That policy allowed Russian gas exports to Europe last year to rise to record levels, while LNG suppliers or pipeline competitors like Norway's Statoil saw their European market shares shrink.

Russia has begun building South Stream to carry up to 15 percent of Europe's annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018.
It also requires bilateral agreements between Russia and the nations through which South Stream will pass to comply with EU legislation.
The European Commission has made clear the South Stream pipeline faces a long wait for legal clearance.

Poland urges Germany to buy less Russian gas#http://euobserver.com/foreign/123410#1394485181905#Polish leader Donald Tusk has said Germany should reduce its gas dependence on Russia for the sake of EU foreign policy.
“German dependence on Russian gas could effectively limit European sovereignty,” Tusk said.
Russian state firm Gazprom has also threatened to stop deliveries to Ukraine, which transits Russian gas to Europe, over unpaid bills.
Some EU countries - such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Lithuania - get all their gas from Russia, while Germany relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its supplies.
In a sign of Germany and Russia’s ever-closer energy relations, Merkel in 2011 turned on the taps at Nord Stream, a €7.4 billion pipeline to bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
London warns utilities against exploiting Ukrainian crisis#http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/03/10/London-warns-utilities-against-exploiting-Ukrainian-crisis/UPI-12981394454874/#1394485182072#LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.
European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption.
With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis.
"Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance," he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday.
"So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices."

You might argue that selling natural gas to Europe means there is less to use here.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes betweenUkraine and Russia have led to supply cuts.
Recent advancements have made it possible for Russian gas that normally flows to European Union customers through Ukraine to flow in the other direction, so Poland and Hungary could supply gas to Ukraine if Russian supplies halted.

Not mentioned by any of the commentators touting the U.S. natural gas "weapon" is that U.S. natural gas imports for 2013 were about 2.88 tcf or about 11 percent of U.S. consumption.
Certainly, it is true that low U.S. natural gas prices have reduced drilling and exploration dramatically.
As my colleague Jeffrey Brown has pointed out, "Citi Research [an arm of Citigroup] puts the decline rate for existing U.S. natural gas production at about 24%/year, which would require the industry to replace about 100% of current U.S. natural gas production in four years, just to maintain current production."
Only that would explain the current hoopla over the nonexistent U.S. oil and natural gas "weapon" in the face of the all-too-obvious and readily available evidence.

EU starts preparing sanctions against Russia#http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/politics/52408.html#1394485187540#The European foreign policy service has begun preparing proposals for sanctions against Russia, which the EU threatens to introduce in case of the absence of effective dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, says Maya Kosyanchich, the press secretary of the head of EU diplomacy Catherine Ashton.
On Thursday, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy stated about the results of an extraordinary EU summit that the EU could impose visa sanctions and freezing of assets on Russia, if in the next few days a dialogue between Russia and Ukraine do not begin.
According to him, the relevant services of the EU will prepare proposals on sanctions in the near future.
Council's statement does not say what group of Russian citizens could fall under EU sanctions.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Russia expects understanding of the counter-productivity of possible imposition of unilateral sanctions against Moscow by Western countries.
The Energy Weapon#http://wallstreetpit.com/102934-the-energy-weapon/#1394485187842#There’s a lot of talk about exploiting the US energy boom to undermine Putin and Russia.
All of these factors are quite uncertain, and if the experience of the past decade says anything, it says be leery about making predictions about natural gas supply.
In brief: US energy export policy is stupid, but fixing the stupidity will have no appreciable impact on Russia for years.
Similarly, fixing stupid European policies on energy (e.g., fracking bans, massive renewables subsidies like Energiewende) should be done for reasons independent of geopolitics, and even if done tomorrow will have no material impact on European energy prices or Russian energy revenues for years to come.
The main way to impose substantial costs on Russia today via energy would be to impose trade sanctions.

Rand Paul's solution to Ukraine: Drill in “every possible conceivable place”#http://www.salon.com/2014/03/10/rand_pauls_solution_to_ukraine_drill_in_every_possible_conceivable_place/#1394485189405#If presidential straw poll winner and CPAC rock star Rand Paul were actually president, the senator told Fox News Sunday, his response to the current crisis in Ukraine would be to order up some drilling -- and lots of it.
“I would do something differently from the president,” Paul said.
The New York Times editorial board conceded in an Op-Ed that "increasing natural gas exports could serve American foreign-policy interests in Europe, which gets about 30 percent of its gas from Russia."
However, the Times was quick to caution, "even if the government approved more exports, setting up more facilities to liquefy and ship gas would take years and cost billions of dollars," while Putin "would not stand idly by."
Paul, for his part, pushed even harder for fossil fuels in an Op-Ed for Time, in which he again emphasized what he sees as the role of oil and gas in addressing the crisis:
272 Protesters Have Vanished in Ukraine#http://www.newser.com/story/183529/272-protesters-have-vanished-in-ukraine.html#1394485189581#(Newser) – Since protests started in Ukraine last December, 661 people have been reported missing—and 272 are still unaccounted for as of last week.
This even after opposition members have been given the go-ahead to look for them in prisons, morgues, and hospitals.
The figure comes courtesy of Euromaidan SOS, whose coordinator predicts that most of those still missing will resurface.
The Euromaidan SOS coordinator insists that rumors of authorities burning bodies of dozens they killed are likely false, yet he notes that bloodstains were found at some police stations where protesters were held.
DNA tests are needed, he says, but "this is a huge amount of work, and there is some chance that the police will not do it."

German reliance on Russian gas threatens Europe, says Poland#http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/german-reliance-russian-gas-threatens-europe-says-poland-20140310#1394485190125#WARSAW (AFP) - Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned Monday amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.
"Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty.
I have no doubt," Mr Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
"I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money," Mr Tusk said.
Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Don't Send America's Natural Gas to Ukraine#http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/natural-gas-export-ukraine-104414.html#1394485190865#In The Arena Don’t Send America’s Natural Gas to UkraineRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has given a boost to those calling for the United States to expedite natural gas exports to help allies overseas.
The spot price of 1 million BTUs, expressed as mmbtu, derived from natural gas is about $4.30.
That means that from a pure economic standpoint, the upside of replacing coal with natural gas is zero, while that of replacing oil with natural gas is $12.7 per mmbtu.
This means that no matter how cheap and plentiful natural gas becomes, its pathway to our vehicles is blocked.
But as long as our cars are locked to gasoline, America’s natural gas will go to fuel power plants in Asia and Europe instead of cars at home.
Is Washington Using the Ukraine Crisis to Push Natural Gas Exports to Asia?#http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/is-washington-using-the-ukraine-crisis-to-push-natural-gas-exports-to-asia-140310\?news=852645#1394485191058#In fact, its biggest customer is Germany, which buys more Russian natural gas than any other nation.
It’s not like the U.S. has a trans-Atlantic pipeline ready to go for shipping natural gas to the other side of the world.
Here’s why:To export natural gas, companies first have to convert it into a liquid to facilitate transporting it.
Asia’s demand for LNG is the real reason why Washington wants to ramp up U.S. exports, leaving Ukraine still at the mercy of Russia’s natural gas powerhouse, Gazprom.

WashWire Daily Brief: Russia's Gas Grip#http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/03/10/washwire-daily-brief-russias-gas-grip/#1394485191461#Welcome to the new WashWire Daily Brief newsletter, the Journal’s morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.
In the latest sign of growing pressure on Moscow to end its occupation of the Crimea region, Western officials are scrambling to loosen Russia’s energy stranglehold on Ukraine.
Officials are considering larger exports of U.S.-made natural gas, reversing the flow of natural gas through pipelines from Western Europe back into Ukraine, and accelerating plans across Europe to buy more energy from countries other than Russia.
If no immediate solution can be found, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague warned Sunday, European countries will shift their energy and economic links to Russia “over time.”
Energy Markets Watching the Diplomats#http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/energy-markets-watching-the-diplomats/#1394485191654#Energy markets are watching the diplomats.
As the crisis in Crimea continues, The Wall Street Journal reports that Western officials are “scrambling” to loosen Russia’s energy stranglehold on Ukraine.
ENERGY MATTERS: Energy plays big role in conflicts#http://www.oaoa.com/editorial/columns/guest_columns/article_f2b4cf92-a7e1-11e3-9f66-0017a43b2370.html#1394485191847#Russia supplies the majority of Ukraine’s natural gas and Ukraine serves as a critical transit route for sending Russian natural gas via pipeline into Europe.
Aware of its reliance on Russia, and seeking energy independence, Ukraine has taken several steps to move away from the grip Moscow holds over its energy supplies.
Poland is due to complete a large LNG import terminal on the Baltic this year — and Poland is already supplying some of Ukraine’s natural gas needs.
The FT reports: “The EU’s access to American LNG exports is one of the most critical questions in determining Europe’s energy security and industrial competiveness.”Ukraine knows that developing its own resources is imperative to its energy security.
1   As this current conflict highlights, he who controls the energy controls the people — and this is exactly why America’s continued energy abundance is important for our own energy security and that of our friends.
Ukraine crisis not an excuse to raise energy prices#http://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/news/2014/03/10/ukraine-crisis-not-an-excuse-to-raise-energy-prices/#1394485192015#Energy Secretary Ed Davey has ruled out energy companies hiking their prices due to the conflict in Ukraine as gas is typically bought 18 months in advance, and they should therefore be protected from short-term price fluctuations.
Experts have, however, added that moderate winter temperatures mean many of Europe’s energy companies are in possession of larger than usual gas reserves.
So they shouldn’t be using it as an excuse to put up people’s prices.
“But we have seen when this crisis broke there was a spike in oil and gas prices.
In this context, he commented on the need for additional energy to be produced via wind and nuclear power stations, as well as shale gas extraction.
Prodan: Price for Russian gas could stand at $368.5#http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/prodan-price-for-russian-gas-could-stand-at-3685-338930.html#1394485192492#“We expect Russia to export gas to us at $368.5 per 1,000 cubic meters,” he told reporters in Kyiv on Sunday.
Ukraine continues repaying debts for gas, and there are no reasons to halt gas exports, he said.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the press on March 7 that Ukraine’s growing debts for Russian gas were generating a new transit crisis.
“In fact, this means that Ukraine has stopped making payments for Russian gas, which is absolutely at odds with the contract and with international trade practice.
The early 2009 transit crisis, when Europe remained cut from Russian gas supplies for 20 days, could re-emerge for the first time over the past five years.

Cheney: Obama 'Hasn't Gotten Any Credibility With Our Allies'#http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/03/10/cheney-obama-hasnt-gotten-any-credibility-with-our-allies/#1394485193162#(credit: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says President Barack Obama is looking weak among global leaders as the Ukraine crisis continues to unfold.
Speaking to CBS News’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Cheney stated that the president “hasn’t gotten any credibility with our allies.”“We have created an image around the world not just for the Russians, of weakness, of indecisiveness,” Cheney said.
Cheney also called for Obama to reinstate the proposed Bush-era missile defense program in Poland and the Czech Republic that the president ended up scrapping in 2009.
[Russian President Vladimir Putin] cares a lot about that,” Cheney told “Face the Nation.” “Conduct joint military exercises with our NATO friends close to the Russian border.
“Either we take a lead or the international system goes back to the chaos and high-risk levels that existed before World War I and between World War I and World War II,” he said.

United States Natural Gas Will Never Weaken Russia's Position#http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/fool/article/United-States-Natural-Gas-Will-Never-Weaken-5302220.php#1394485195018#Events this week sparked plenty of commentary on the United States using its vast natural gas resources as a diplomatic weapon to soften Russia's hand.
While the United States is currently sitting on an ocean of inexpensive natural gas, exporting the fuel will not weaken Russia's resource control over Europe for three reasons.
Even if prices skyrocketed in Europe, LNG regasification and natural gas storage is severely inadequacy.
Finally, Russian natural gas is produced from conventional wells, making it the cost leader, effectively giving Russia command over market share and holding the winning hand.

Previous disputes over gas payments between Russia and Ukraine have caused Russia to cut off supplies.
The same pipelines that bring Russian gas to Ukraine also supply eastern Europe, creating shortages there.
The White House has said that a mild European winter has created above average gas supplies and that any new exports would be unlikely to reach Europe before the end of 2015.

White House plays down speedy role for US natural gas in Ukraine#http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2014/03/08/White-House-downplays-role-of-natural-gas-policy-in-Ukraine-crisis/#1394485199642#ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.
"There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region," he said.
Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic.
As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.
But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

Council of Europe offers to monitor treatment of minorities in Ukraine#http://news.yahoo.com/council-europe-offers-monitor-treatment-minorities-ukraine-111744525--finance.html#1394485200631#By Michael ShieldsVIENNA (Reuters) - The Council of Europe, the pan-European human rights watchdog, is offering to investigate violence and the treatment of minorities in Ukraine to try to defuse mounting tensions between Kiev and Russia, Austria said.
Both Russia and Ukraine are members of the Council of Europe, which Kurz said had credibility and expertise in supporting minority rights.
The Council of Europe is best known for drawing up the European Convention on Human Rights, which entered into force in 1953 and established the European Court of Human Rights.
Asked how Russia had reacted so far to the mediation offer, Kurz said: "At least there have been no negative voices in the Council of Europe from the Russian side."
The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is also trying to mediate in Ukraine.

While global escalation of the current conflict remains a possibility in Ukraine, we think this is unlikely as it is in the interest of all parties to have a unified and stable Ukraine.
Amid an escalation of conflict, Russia has suspended its financial aid package, which had been keeping Ukraine solvent.
The EU might come through with some aid, but it will probably not be close to what Ukraine needs.
As we see it, Russia certainly does not want an unstable government in Ukraine and the EU certainly does not want it in view of the enormous amounts of gas that are pumped to Europe from Russia to Ukraine.

The transaction will create a combined company valued at $US1.07 billion ($A1.19 billion) named ChiquitaFyffes, a fresh produce company with annual revenue of $US4.6 billion, the companies said in a joint statement.
The combined company will become the leading global banana and other fresh produce company, with sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas a year, they said.
The deal puts together two storied banana companies that began in the 19th century as modest suppliers and grew into global powerhouses.
The combined company will have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.

The merger seems to help with that; some 71% of the new company’s sales will come from bananas, compared with 65% of Chiquita’s.
Assuming the new company passes antitrust muster, a lot of ChiquitaFyffes’ new non-banana business will come from melons and pineapples, in which Fyffes has been investing pretty heavily (pdf, p.19).
For one thing, both melons and pineapples are proving promising for Fyffes.

Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte control more than 80 percent of the world’s banana trade, according to the United Nations.
Chiquita estimates that the acquisition will result in annual revenue of $4.6 billion and produce operational savings of about $40 million by the end of 2016.

Fyffes, the 126-year-old fruit supplier famous for its blue-label branding, is to become half of the world’s biggest banana company by merging with Chiquita, its larger American rival, the companies said yesterday.
Chiquita and Fyffes sell a combined 160 million boxes of bananas a year, which would put the new group comfortably ahead of its rivals Del Monte, which sells 117 million boxes a year, and Dole, which sells 110 million.

What: Shares of Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (UNKNOWN:CQB.DL) were looking ripe today, climbing as much as 19% after announcing a merger with Fyffes, a produce company based in Ireland.
So what: The merger will create a new company known as ChiquitaFyffes, 50.7% of which will be owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3% to be owned by Fyffes shareholders, though the two brands will continue to operate separately.
Investors on both sides clearly seem to approve of the merger as Fyffes' shares jumped 44% on the news, but several analysts said the deal is reflective of weakness in the industry and could prompt further consolidation.
Chiquita and Fyffes expect the deal to close by the end of the year.

Keith.
The original “Banana Republic” was Honduras: United Fruit Company had many banana plantations, practically controlled the country economically and got involved in politics as well.
The many countries in Latin America that were dominated by United Fruit Company (UFCo) in the first half of the 20th century certainly fit that definition.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which imports banas through Portsmouth, also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.
Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of 3 billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) and 20,000 staff.
Shareholders in the North Carolina-based company will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at 526 million US dollars (£314.5 million).

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” said Chiquita head Ed Lonergan, in BBC.
The newly formed company will be listed in New York, and shareholders will get shares in both firms, BBC reported.
Fyffes‘ shareholders will own just at 49.3 percent of the merged firm, BBC said.
The deal was made with both cost cuts and expansions in mind, Mr. Lonergan said.

The New York-listed combined company will have tax savings from being domiciled in Ireland, similar to U.S. drugmaker Perrigo's acquisition of Elan last year.
Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held.
The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80 percent of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals - Chiquita, Fyffes, Fresh Del Monte and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company - according to the United Nations.
Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board andLazard for Fyffes.

This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.
Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year.
Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming.

For emerging markets Chinese gloom added more strain, compounding worries over the U.S. turning off the taps on the cheap money that has been flowing to them.
Part of the attraction is that central banks such as the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England have promised to keep interest rates down for as long as they can.
There was a shot across the bows for that tactic over the weekend, however, from the central bank of central banks, the Bank of International Settlements, warning it raised “the risk of an unhealthy accumulation of financial imbalances”.
The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude oil down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains.

China surprised the market last month too, posting a 10.6% year-on-year increase in January exports, whereas the market had expected a 0.1% rise.
This time last year, the exports data were artificially inflated by hot money inflow in the disguise of "exports".
Comparing to December's 7.5% adjusted growth reading, the new data, without down, is a signal that China's exports sector has slowed.

Whistling Past The Graveyard After China's 1st Ever Bond Default#http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonchang/2014/03/09/whistling-past-the-graveyard-after-chinas-1st-ever-bond-default/#1394490296219#On Friday, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. failed to make an 89.8 million yuan ($14.7 million) interest payment, the first domestic corporate bond default in the history of the People’s Republic of China.
Then, the Shanghai municipality leaned on banks to not press claims on overdue loans so that Chaori could pay bondholders.
Even more remarkably, authorities let Chaori default during the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, a particularly sensitive moment in the Chinese political calendar.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in aresearch note issued on the Wednesday after the company’s warning, called the then-potential default China’s “Bear Stearns moment.”That assessment angered Xinhua News Agency.

The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.
However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal.

Bond default crisis in China 'unlikely' this year#http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/10/bond-default-crisis-in-china-unlikely-this-year/#1394490297421#Investors might be nervous about worrying data out of China this morning, but research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch argues a Chinese financial crisis is unlikely.
But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.
“A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,” he said.
The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.
And we would expect the Chinese authorities to act forcefully, and set aside moral hazard concerns, if a systemic crisis emerges.”
Shanghai copper slides 5pc on China concerns#http://www.brecorder.com/markets/commodities/australia/161540-shanghai-copper-slides-5pc-on-china-concerns.html#1394490297915#SYDNEY: Shanghai copper dropped by its 5 percent daily limit on Monday to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country's first domestic bond default last week.
London copper prices slid to within a whisker of nearly three-year lows, after shedding nearly 4 percent on Friday.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had dropped 1.1 percent to $6,709.25 a tonne by 0256 GMT.
Reflecting ample supply, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet.
China is the world's top user of copper, accounting for 45 percent of global demand.
Failed issuance shows growing risk awareness#http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/847425.shtml#1394490298100#More sophisticated Western investors are already well-aware of these risks, and seldom complain when high-yield products sometimes fail to deliver promised returns.
In the past, domestic investors almost certainly would have given a company like Jin Jiang as much money as it wanted regardless of the return rate.
But rejection of the Jin Jiang bond shows investors increasingly realizing they must be responsible for their own decisions, and that they can't depend on State bailouts when problems emerge.
In that case, the product was backed by a Shanxi coal mining company that ultimately failed, resulting in the default.
But investors complained that they should have been protected from any risk since ICBC marketed the product.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from i$6,782 at the close on Friday.
It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

China defaulter Chaori has 'four or five' trust loans outstanding#http://www.ifre.com/china-defaulter-chaori-has-four-or-five-trust-loans-outstanding/21135578.article#1394490299359#Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology has at least four outstanding trust loans due this year, the source said.
Chaori issued six trust loans in 2011, the source said.
The first one, the Rmb80m China Industrial International Trust, was issued on April 21 2011 and matured on October 20 2012.
There was a cap of Rmb50m on each of the Zhongrong-arranged trust loans, which means the total of outstanding trust loans could amount to as much as Rmb250m.
Chaori also owes 18 banks including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China about Rmb1.7bn.

Managers voice concerns as China bond nears default#http://www.ftadviser.com/2014/03/10/investments/asia-pacific/managers-voice-concerns-as-china-bond-nears-default-c5dW9hAHJKst2LMmVNJzzH/article.html#1394490299670#Managers have voiced caution on China, as the country faces up to its first default of an onshore corporate bond since the market became regulated in the late 1990s.
Concerns have grown in recent months about the stability of China’s $12trn (£7.2trn) corporate bond market in recent weeks as rumours of potential defaults have spread.
Lu Yu, manager on Allianz Global Investors’ emerging markets equity team, warned that the Chaori Solar bond default could be the catalyst for a short-term equity market crash in China.
“A default would be a wake up call for Chinese banks, but I don’t think Chinese credit is going to have a big crisis like we saw in Europe and the US.
He added: “We don’t see a disorderly bank collapse or local government default as being yet on the cards.
World stocks pause, commodities fall#http://www.iol.co.za/business/international/world-stocks-pause-commodities-fall-1.1658947#1394490299897#London - World stocks paused near a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine.

LME Copper at Eight-Month Lows on China Demand Fears#http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140310-703269.html#1394490300518#By Laura ClarkeLONDON--The price of copper, which has fallen 10% in 2014, sank again Monday to its lowest price in over eight months amid concerns about demand from top consumer China.
The red metal shed nearly 4% Friday after the first default in China's corporate-bond market.
Three-month copper was 1.7% down from Friday's closing price, at $6,669.25 per metric tonne, having earlier hit its lowest price since June 2013 at $6,608 per tonne.
FastMarkets and Newedge both said the rout had left the red metal looking oversold.
"In fundamental terms, on the other hand, the global copper market is fairly tight, meaning there is no long-term justification for low prices."

China stocks slump on lackluster economic indicators#http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/847333.shtml#1394490305211#Chinese shares tumbled on Monday morning after economic data released over the weekend showed a sharp drop in exports in February.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.69 percent to finish at 2,023.22, while the Shenzhen Component Index declined 1.45 percent to close at 7,222.02.Companies related to ship and aircraft manufacturing, furniture and development zones led the decline.
The sub-index for ship manufacturing fell 4.54 percent.The sharp slump was mainly attributed to China's February customs data released on Saturday that showed the first trade deficit in 11 months, which contrasted with the huge surpluses last February and this January.In addition, the country's producer price index, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, contracted for 24 consecutive months in February, further compounding the gloomy outlook among investors.Although China's economic growth has shown signs of stabilizing after a slowdown in 2011, downward pressures still existed and cannot be ignored this year, analysts said.The tourism and aviation sector also suffered.
The average share price of 23 listed tourism companies lost 2.19 percent by midday, and prices of eight airlines dropped 2.76 percent.The missing Malaysia flight MH370 , carrying 227 passengers, remained unlocated after the loss of its radar signal at 1:20 a.m. on Saturday.Factors including the largest volume of lock-up shares becoming tradable this week and the restart of initial public offerings in March also contributed to the decline.

At 0619 GMT, the CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares listings was down 3 percent at its lowest intra-day level since June 25.
The Shanghai Composite Index was down 2.6 percent.
Exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 percent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday.

This default has caused quite a stir among analysts, many of whom view this as an opportunity for China’s corporate bond market to enhance its risk pricing mechanism.
This highlights some issues with China’s corporate bond market.
Third, while the corporate bond market in China for bonds with AA- ratings or above is relatively liquid, the market for bonds with ratings below this mark is relatively illiquid, further reinforcing the bond market bifurcation.
Without some fundamental, institutional changes in China’s financial economy, “market forces” will continue to be prevented from taking shape.

"Unlike Hong Kong where insurers can freely introduce any new insurance products, in China all insurance companies must first get regulatory approval before any new product launch.
Manuel Bauer, a board member of German insurer Allianz, one of the first batch of foreign insurers in 1999, said it would be tough to compete with mainland insurers.
Despite the low market share, foreign insurers experienced strong growth in mainland sales and future prospects were bright, he said.
The country is still in its early stage of development in the insurance market," said Bauer.

"Metals were rocked by the Chinese corporate default," said Michael Turek, director of metals trading with futures brokerage Newedge.

More Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency#http://shanghaiist.com/2014/03/09/more_chinese_women_marrying_elderly.php#1394490316866#Hong Kong has experienced a notable increase in the number of young mainland Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency, and in many cases, housing.
The South China Morning Post cites the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department reporting an increase in the number of documented elderly abuse cases, from 589 in 2013, 408 in 2012, and a mere 368 from 2011-2010.
More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants “over 60 years old living on welfare,” and cautioned such men to “use caution” as such marriages often turn out “too good to be true.”The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers’ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.

SEC Urges Muni Issuers, Underwriters to Report Violations#http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/123_47/sec-urges-muni-issuers-underwriters-to-report-violations-1060557-1.html#1394492392258#Ben WatkinsWASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday launched an effort to encourage issuers and underwriters of municipal securities to self-report certain violations of the federal securities laws rather than wait for their violations to be detected.
Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires underwriters to reasonably determine that an issuer will comply with its continuing disclosure agreement before underwriting any new municipal securities.
The rule also requires new offering documents to include descriptions of any continuing disclosure violations in the past five years.
Last year an SEC probe examined underwriters in California, and a July 2013 enforcement action targeted both West Clark Community Schools in Clark County, Ind.
"The SEC has already advised issuers and underwriters of their concerns, and all parties are paying careful attention to such advice," he said.

SEC Asks Municipal Bond Sellers to Report Violations#http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-10/sec-asks-municipal-bond-sellers-to-report-violations.html#1394492393241#SHARE THIS ARTICLE Facebook Twitter LinkedIn EmailThe Securities and Exchange Commission urged municipal borrowers and underwriters to voluntarily report violations, allowing them to avoid steeper penalties after an investigation.
The regulator today said it created an enforcement program providing standardized settlements for borrowers and banks that report running afoul of the law.
For states and cities, it would let them avoid financial penalties.
“It could be a very effective and efficient tool by the SEC,” said Elaine Greenberg, the former head of the SEC enforcement division that pursued municipal bond cases and now a partner with Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP in Washington.
For state and local governments that qualify, the SEC would recommend that the case be settled without financial penalties.
