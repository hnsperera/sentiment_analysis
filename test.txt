Fed's Charles Plosser sees high bar for change in pace of tapering#http://www.livemint.com/Politics/H2EvwJSK2VE6OF7iK1g3PP/Feds-Charles-Plosser-sees-high-bar-for-change-in-pace-of-ta.html#1394470371207#Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser, who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn’t enough to change the pace of the central bank’s asset purchases.
Policy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,” Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers.
The numbers were “encouraging,” though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,” he said.
The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%.
Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006.
